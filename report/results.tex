\section{Results}
For all these results we used $400$ images for training of which a $\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ each contained food, a
$\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ contained other objects and the rest were pictures of the empty table. The training data was picked
at random from the set of photos collected in the first four days. To validate our choices we then used the trained SVMs
on $5000$ test images. 

\subsection{Raw Images}
The SVM using raw images misclassified $862$ of the $5000$ images (a $17.24\%$ failure rate). The failures involved both
false positives and false negatives.

\subsection{Shi-Tomassi Vectors}
The SVM using raw images misclassified $77$ of the $5000$ images (a $1.54\%$ failure rate). The failures involved both
false positives and false negatives.

\subsection{HOG Vectors}
Using HOG vectors all images were misclassified as containing no food. 

Next we discuss some reasons for our results.
